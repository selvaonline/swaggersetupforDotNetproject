o implement Swagger in an ASP.NET Core Web API project, you can follow these steps:

Install the required NuGet packages:

Swashbuckle.AspNetCore: This package provides the necessary libraries for integrating Swagger into your ASP.NET Core Web API project.
Configure Swagger in the Startup.cs file:

In the ConfigureServices method, add the following code to enable Swagger and configure the Swagger UI:
services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>
{
    c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo { Title = "Your API Name", Version = "v1" });
});


In the Configure method, add the following code to enable the Swagger UI endpoint:

Build the project to ensure there are no compilation errors.
Run the project by selecting "Debug" > "Start Debugging" or pressing F5.
Access the Swagger UI:

Open a web browser and navigate to the Swagger UI endpoint. By default, it is available at https://localhost:<port>/swagger.
You should now see the Swagger UI page, where you can explore and test your API endpoints. The Swagger UI provides a user-friendly interface to interact with your API and view the available endpoints, request/response models, and even allows you to test the API directly from the UI.

Please note that these steps provide a basic implementation of Swagger in an ASP.NET Core Web API project. You can further customize the Swagger configuration and documentation based on your specific requirements.
